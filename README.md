## Conclusion

Qubihub represents a critical infrastructure project for the Qubic ecosystem. By providing a comprehensive, user-friendly platform that consolidates essential tools and features, Qubihub will significantly lower barriers to entry, encourage adoption, and accelerate ecosystem growth. The platform's focus on developer tools, user experience, and community engagement positions it as a cornerstone of the Qubic ecosystem.

## Motivation
While working in Qubic Ecosystem, I felt lack of developer utilities like Polkadot.js App in Qubic ecosystem. Especially working in integration with smart contract, it was very difficult to analyze smart contract transactions and detailed internal state changes. So I always used my own script collection, cli collection for interacting with smart contract. I was looking forward to new project like Polkadot.js App in Qubic, finally Qforge came out, provided rich experience in smart contract test. But while development and supporting QubicBay tickets, I still felt bad experience of transaction analyze, especially Qubic official explorer was not enough for smart contract interaction, it took so much time to get all necessary info using different tools, different APIs. So I decided to build my own tool, so built Qubihub POC version quickly. It helped me so much in QubicBay development and maintanence. I want to continue building of Qubihub and finish it with the help of incubation.

> [!NOTE]
> After complete POC version, it will be public repository, welcome to any PR, issues, feedbacks.   
> I want this project is advancing as community-driven project. ğŸ’–
